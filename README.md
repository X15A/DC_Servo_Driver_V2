# DC_Servo_Driver_V2
 Updated and slightly improved version of my DC motor servo driver software. Originally programmed to run on an arduino nano and drive an N20 gearmotor with encoder to make an ultralight 3D printer extruder motor. I originally used a DRV8871 motor driver in conjunction with the arduino to drive the servo, however I am designing a low cost motor driver PCB with all required control hardware integrated (atmega328, ch340, DRV8871, current limiter, and CAN IC) that I will be releasing for sale in the future. I may also develop a driver capable of driving more powerful DC motors if there is interest as well.
 
Licensed under the "common clause" licensing terms in the spirit of open sourced software(https://commonsclause.com/). The goal of using common clause is to allow anyone to freely use, modify, and improve this code however they see fit, only preventing this code from being sold without value added. This does not limit this code from commercial use either, so companies may feel free to use it in their own projects and equipment.
 Value added is defined specifically as some addition (hardware or software) that improves or augments the functionality of this code. For example, selling custom driver boards uploaded with this firmware would be considered value added, therefore is allowed. The primary purpose of this limitation is to protect people from being sold freeware when it is already free to download and use online.
